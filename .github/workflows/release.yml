            ## What's New in v1.4.0

            ### Update Notifications
            Never miss an update! The app now automatically checks for new releases and notifies you when updates are available.

            - **Automatic Update Checks** - Checks GitHub releases on startup and every 6 hours
            - **Update Banner** - Non-intrusive banner at the top of the screen when a new version is available
            - **Release Notes Preview** - View release notes directly in the app before downloading
            - **Dismissable** - Dismiss notifications per-version (won't nag you repeatedly)
            - **Settings > About Tab** - New About tab with version info and manual "Check for Updates" button
            - **Quick Links** - Easy access to GitHub repo, issues, and releases

            ### Auto-Tuner Improvements
            Major reliability improvements to prevent the auto-tuner from going idle.

            #### Hybrid Pause Mode
            - **Safety Checks Always Run** - Flatline detection and error monitoring continue even when tuner is paused
            - **Auto-Optimization Continues** - Periodic efficiency optimization runs regardless of pause state
            - **Only Temperature Adjustments Pause** - When temp is ideal, only the temp-based adjustments pause

            #### Ambient Temperature Spike Detection
            - **Monitors Temperature While Paused** - Detects gradual temperature increases due to ambient conditions
            - **Auto-Resume on Spike** - If temperature rises 3°C+ from when paused (after 5 minutes), tuner automatically resumes
            - **Notification** - Toast notification when ambient spike is detected
            - **Prevents Thermal Creep** - Catches scenarios where room temp increases (AC off, afternoon sun, etc.)

            ### Bug Fixes
            - Fixed auto-tuner going idle after ~1 hour when temperature stabilized in ideal range
            - Fixed safety checks (flatline detection) being blocked when tuner was paused
            - Fixed auto-optimization not running while tuner was paused

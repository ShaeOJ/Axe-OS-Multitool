## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: #3498db (a medium blue). The use case involves computer equipment, suggesting the cool, professional and reliable feeling conveyed by blue tones. A somewhat saturated blue can suggest technical competence, without getting as showy or rave-like as a green.
- Background color: #ecf0f1 (a light gray, almost white). In a light color scheme, gray imparts an appropriate understated feel.
- Accent color: #9b59b6 (a medium purple). Analogous to the blue tone of the primary color, but distinctive and saturated enough to attract the user's attention.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif typeface suitable for UI because of its focus on legibility. 
- Use simple, outline-style icons to represent different data points and miner metrics.
- Use a card-based layout for displaying miner information, ensuring a clean and organized presentation.
- Incorporate subtle animations for data updates and chart transitions to provide a smooth user experience.
